# FizzBuzz

The FizzBuzz problem is a classic test given in coding interviews.

The coding test is as follows:

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
- But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
